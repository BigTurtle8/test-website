		<h1>Hippo's Hope</h1>
		<p>
			There once was a hippo who wanted to fly--<br>
			Fly-hi-dee, try-hi-dee, my-hi-dee-ho.<br>
			So he sewed him some wings that could flap though the sky--<br>
			Sky-hi-dee, fly-hi-dee, why-hi-dee-go.<br>
			<br>
			He climbed to the top of a mountain of snow--<br>
			Snow-hi-dee, slow-hi-dee, oh-hi-dee-hoo.<br>
			With the clouds high above and the sea down below--<br>
			Where-hi-dee, there-hi-dee, scare-hi-dee-boo.
